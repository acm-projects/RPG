# RPG

RPG is a game with endless maps to explore and enemies to slice through. Through procedural generation, no map will look the same as you explore and find the final boss room. Although the backstory and setting of the game will be decided by the participants, it will be a 2D Top Down RPG hack and slash roguelike.
